# emacs-configuration

Emacs settings running on an Ubuntu 14.04 with Emacs 24-5.

This configuration is mostly inspired by
[magnars](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d) and
[purcell](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d) setups.

## Initialization

During first start-up, Emacs will install every not installed packages used.

You might want to check out the `settings/key-bindings.el` file to watch most of the key bindings used.

## Keyboard configuration

I'm using the [b√©po](https://bepo.fr/wiki/Accueil) layout which might explain
some of the key bindings.
